This Course Is...

- Fast, effective pathway to learn Python
- Full of exercises, challenges, quizzes
- Made for normal people who can't stand 20 minute videos. Average video is 4 minutes!
- An ideal on-ramp to data science, Machine Learning, or web development courses

### What This Course Is Not

- A 60 hour Python encyclopedia course that covers every possible feature of Python
- An advanced level Python course for experts
- A web development, data science, or machine learning oriented course

### Why You Should Learn Python

High Demand

- There are more Python jobs today than ever before
- Salaries for them are at an all-time high
- If you could pick only one language to learn, many argue it should be Python!

Huge Community
